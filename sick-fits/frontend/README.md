## Next.js

Next.js automatically handles routing to pages that are listed in the 'pages' folder. The '\_.app' file imports the App and Component parts from next.js to provide a wrapper for your entire application.

NProgress is the project bar.

In development, next.js will build pages on demand but in production, these pages will be prebuilt. 'Link' also contains a prefetch option that can prefetch the data along with the built page.
